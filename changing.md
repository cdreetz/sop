## a changing world

one of the most important concepts to master today is the idea of relational changes, rate of change, if x changes by 1 how 
much does y change, gradients, correlations, etc etc. there are 100 different ways to view these relationships and every 
field calls it something else, sometimes within a single field it can have a number of names, but it all boils down to the 
same underlying concept or understanding relationships.  a chef needs to know the relationship of fats to acids in recipes, 
a race car driving needs to understand the relationship between the clouds overhead and the condition of the road, a 
machine learning engineer has to understand the relationship between the natural language and how a computer can represent 
the relationship across vocabularies.  it's why high tech people are often easily transferable, physicists can become 
machine learning engineers quite easily, statisticians become data scientsts.  analogies are one of the most powerful 
techniques for humans to explain to humans and more so language models to explain concepts to an individual with no prior 
knowledge of a concept but through the relationship to a concept they are familiar with.


learning gradient derivation starting with add and going to mul and so on is a great bridge to learn gradients and 
derivatives.
