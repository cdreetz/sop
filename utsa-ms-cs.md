## MS CS Program

### Focus Areas
The concentrations for the MS-CS program are Cybersecurity, Software Engineering and Data 
Science.  Some of the faculty research areas include algorithms, high performance computing, 
parallel and distributed systems, and software engineering, along with many others.


### Possible Research Topics

- Hierarchial Ensembles will be able to perform similarly to large MoE models with the 
efficiency of energy management systems.  HE are applicable to embedded systems for the 
energy aspect and applicable to server hosted systems for latency and accuracy 
performance.  Airport security cameras use a system that activates models in the order of 
1 Object Detection: Faces 2 Generalized Object Classification to segment people of 
interest 3 Fine Tuned Object Classification to ID individual with a higher confidence 
than general classification.  Each model is an Expert at its respective step in the 
hierarchy.  Minimize the possible distribution of outcomes a model has to estimate for.  
One large model has millions of possible outcomes to consider.  When split up model 1 
has 2 object or no object and model 2 has POI or no POI and model 3 has classify from 
list of 10 POI


### Faculty

Sumit Jha
BLOOM Large Language Models and the Chomsky Hierarchy
- LLM interpretability is a major interest of mine and an increasingly important research 
topic as we progress with LLMs

Xiaoyin Wang
Leveraging code generation to improve code retrieval and summarization via duel learning
- It has only come more apparant that language models are best pretrained on a wide range 
of tasks or with entirely unsupervised learning and code generation is a particularly 
interesting application of lanugae models for myself

Mining readme files to support automatic building of java projects in software 
repositories
-

Boosting Complete-Code Tool for Partion Programs
- System dependecy graphs for partial programs would be an interesting topic to reapply 
given more advanced language models to see how they can better build complex programs 
with an established dependency graph


Dakai Zhu
The effects of energy management on reliability in real-time embedded systems
- With the increasing size and compute requirements of large models being able to use 
them in embedded systems will be heavily dependent on also developing around energy 
management and hierarchal model activation schemes
*- I strongly believe hierarchial model systems will play a large part in productionizing 
large models not only for energy efficiency but for latency and even accuracy
*- The idea plays directly into my belief that hierarchial ensembles of small fine tuned 
models will end up being the best performing and most efficient model systems ie. MoE

Fatma Arslan
Improved flipped classroom teaching for electromagnetic engineering course
- Adapting to new learning styles is just as important as adapting to new technologies 
today.  The downside is that students are able to adapt to new technologies if they 
choose by going out of there way to learn on their own, but students have no control to 
new classroom learning styles as they are at the mercy of their instructors, some of 
which may or may not have an interest in providing the best teaching they can.
