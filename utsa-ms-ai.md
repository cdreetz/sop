sushil prasad
"Curriculum initiative on parallel and distributed computing"
- i am a strong advocate for teaching critical skills to students in the 
quickly progressing industry and parallel and distributed training is 
something that i enjoyed learning but should have been introduced to earlier
"Azurebench: Benchmarking the storage services of the azure cloud platform"
- something i am very close to as the sole data professional at my company who 
works on the Azure platform.  it has taken me some time to get familiar with 
the wide spectrum of products from different storage types blob, parquet, 
json, csv, gen1, gen2, azure sql server, azure cosmos, along with the compute 
options on azure, azure databricks, etc
- cloud features in general should be introduced in undergrad on a minimum of 
one platform

debaditya chakraborty
"A Hybrid TOPSIS-Structure Entropy Weight Group Subcontractor Selection Model 
for Large Construction Companies
- very interesting research and one close to my own interests as someone who 
has spoken with industry professionals at developer and general contracting 
companies including Turner Construction (largest general contractor in the 
United States) about applying AI/ML to their businesses
"Artificial Intelligence for Developing Accurate Preliminary Cost Estimates 
for Composite Flooring Systems of Multi-Storey Buidlings"
- preconstruction cost estimation is specifically what i was speaking to about 
conducting at construction companies

juan b guiterrez
"A brief summary of text mining"
- the paper states the need for text mining techniques because mass volumes of 
unstructured text cannot be simply processed, and the same time that the 
attention paper came out.  im interested to hear guiterrez thoughts now given 
the uprise of lanaugage models and training specifically on mass unlabaled 
data.  text mining tasks like classification and clustering are still vital as 
large models cannot be applied in most cases and smaller models are useful for 
their specified tasks.
